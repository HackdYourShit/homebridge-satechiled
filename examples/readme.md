Turn a tactile push button connected to a BLE capable microprocessor into a wireless HomeKit switch. Use the Home app or Siri on your Apple device to trigger events based on the switch state.


## Lightbulb Accessory [`lightbulb/`](lightbulb)

Turn an LED connected to a BLE capable microprocessor into a wireless HomeKit lightbulb. Use the Home app or Siri on your Apple device to switch it on and off.


## Lightbulb RGB Accessory [`lightbulb-rgb/`](lightbulb-rgb)

<img src="lightbulb-rgb/images/lightbulb-rgb.jpg" width="50%">

Turn three LEDs connected to a BLE capable microprocessor into a wireless HomeKit lightbulb. Use the Home app or Siri on your Apple device to switch it on and change it's brightness or color. BLE subscribe capability allows the microprocessor to sent events back to the HomeKit whenever an external event changes the state of the light.


## Thermometer Accessory [`thermometer/`](thermometer)
